Certainly! Here are some examples of Python code for arithmetic calculations:

Addition:
python
Copy code
a = 5
b = 3
result = a + b
print("Addition result:", result)
Subtraction:
python
Copy code
a = 10
b = 7
result = a - b
print("Subtraction result:", result)
Multiplication:
python
Copy code
a = 4
b = 6
result = a * b
print("Multiplication result:", result)
Division:
python
Copy code
a = 15
b = 2
result = a / b
print("Division result:", result)
Modulus (remainder after division):
python
Copy code
a = 20
b = 7
result = a % b
print("Modulus result:", result)
Exponentiation:
python
Copy code
a = 2
b = 5
result = a ** b
print("Exponentiation result:", result)
Floor Division (integer division):
python
Copy code
a = 17
b = 4
result = a // b
print("Floor Division result:", result)
These examples demonstrate basic arithmetic operations in Python. You can modify the values of 'a' and 'b' variables to perform calculations with different numbers.
