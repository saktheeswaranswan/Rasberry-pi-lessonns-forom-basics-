MicroPython and CircuitPython are primarily designed for microcontrollers that use ARM Cortex-M or similar architectures. Unfortunately, the microcontrollers you mentioned (AVR, Atmel PIC, and Microchip PIC) are not natively supported by MicroPython or CircuitPython.

MicroPython and CircuitPython have been developed with a focus on ARM-based microcontrollers, which have a more powerful architecture and sufficient resources to run a Python interpreter. The architecture and memory limitations of AVR and older PIC microcontrollers make it challenging to run MicroPython or CircuitPython effectively.

If you're working with AVR, Atmel PIC, or Microchip PIC microcontrollers, you might need to use their respective development environments and programming languages (C or Assembly) to create your projects. These microcontrollers have their own ecosystems and toolchains that are optimized for their specific architectures.

If you're interested in using Python-like languages with these microcontrollers, there are alternatives like "MicroPython-like" implementations tailored for specific microcontroller architectures. However, these might not be as feature-rich or well-maintained as official MicroPython or CircuitPython versions for ARM microcontrollers. Always check the documentation and resources provided by the microcontroller manufacturer or the community for options available for your specific microcontroller.
